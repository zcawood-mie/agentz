# agentz

A modular AI agent configuration system for GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code. Clone it, customize it, make it yours.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo** anywhere you like:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-fork>/agentz.git ~/path/to/agentz
   ```

2. **Tell VS Code where to find it** — open Settings (JSON) and add these five entries, pointing to your clone location:
   ```jsonc
   // Prompts — shows up when you type "/" in chat
   "chat.promptFilesLocations": {
       "~/path/to/agentz/prompts": true
   },
   // Agents — shows up in the agent selector dropdown
   "chat.agentFilesLocations": {
       "~/path/to/agentz/agents": true
   },
   // Skills — domain knowledge loaded by agents on demand
   "chat.agentSkillsLocations": {
       "~/path/to/agentz/skills": true
   },
   // Instructions — injected into every conversation automatically
   "chat.instructionsFilesLocations": {
       "~/path/to/agentz/instructions": true
   },
   // Hooks — lifecycle scripts that run before/after tool calls
   "chat.hookFilesLocations": {
       "~/path/to/agentz/hooks": true
   },
   ```

3. **Try a prompt** — open the chat panel, type `/` and pick one (e.g., `planFeature`, `commitCurrentChanges`)

4. **Pick an agent** — click the agent selector in chat and choose `Implementation` or `Research`

No build step, no package install, no dependencies — just markdown and shell scripts.

## How It Works

The system has five primitives. Each plays a distinct role, and the agent's approach to any task **emerges** from their combination:

```
User
  ↓ (goal via prompt or direct message)
Agent (values + tool access + constraints)
  ↓ (loads relevant context)
Skills (domain knowledge, methodology, contextual rules)
  ↓ (operates within)
Instructions (user preferences, mandatory policies — always active)
  ↓ (at lifecycle points)
Hooks (deterministic behavior — scripts triggered by agent operations)
```

No single primitive dictates step-by-step how to accomplish work. The approach is emergent from the goal, the agent's values, domain knowledge from skills, and user preferences from instructions.

## The Primitives

### Agents — Values + Tool Access + Constraints

Agents define **who** does the work: what tools they can use, what they care about, and what's out of bounds. There are two user-facing agents and many specialized subagents.

| Agent | Role | Tools |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Implementation** | Read-write. Implements, tests, debugs, commits, pushes. | Edit, terminal, search, subagent delegation |
| **Research** | Read-only. Investigates, plans, reviews PRs, creates diagrams. | Search, terminal (read-only), subagent delegation |

Specialized subagents handle narrowly scoped work:

| Subagent | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| SourceWriter | Write code within file boundaries set by orchestrator |
| CodeExplorer | Deep codebase investigation — patterns, data flow |
| CodeScanner | Dead code, security, and refactoring scanning |
| GitHubOps | PR creation, issue linking, GitHub API operations |
| BrowserTest | Chrome DevTools, UI testing, visual verification |
| DatabaseOps | MongoDB queries, data inspection |
| DocFetcher | Library documentation lookup (via Context7) |
| WebSearcher | General web search for technical info |

Review and planning subagents provide **multi-perspective** analysis:

| Category | Subagents |
|----------|-----------|
| **Reviewers** | SecurityReviewer, ArchitectureReviewer, PerformanceReviewer, MaintainabilityReviewer |
| **Planners** | PragmatistPlanner, CraftspersonPlanner, AdvocatePlanner, SecurityPlanner, ScalabilityPlanner, ConceptualistPlanner |
| **Investigators** | DataIntegrityInvestigator, ControlFlowInvestigator, ConcurrencyInvestigator, EnvironmentInvestigator |

**File format:** `agents/AgentName.agent.md` (PascalCase)

### Prompts — Reusable Task Templates

Prompts are pre-written task definitions you invoke with `/` in the chat panel. Each prompt targets an agent and describes the goal — the agent and skills handle the how.

| Prompt | Agent | What It Does |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `implementTicketAuto` | Implementation | Full autonomous ticket-to-PR pipeline from a GitHub issue URL |
| `implementTicketManual` | Implementation | Same pipeline but pauses for plan approval before coding |
| `planFeature` | Research | Research codebase and create a diagram-first implementation plan |
| `reviewMyBranch` | Research | Self-review current branch diff using priority checklist (P1-P10) |
| `reviewPR` | Research | Review a colleague's PR with colleague-mode priorities |
| `commitCurrentChanges` | Implementation | Stage, generate conventional commit message, commit |
| `cleanupBranch` | Implementation | Polish committed changes — diff bloat, naming, style |
| `scanBranch` | Implementation | Scan branch diff for dead code, security issues, refactoring |
| `testCurrentBranch` | Implementation | Create test plan and manually test current changes |
| `fixPRFeedback` | Implementation | Fetch PR review comments and address them one by one |
| `resetProject` | Implementation | Reset to clean state on default branch |
| `reviewSession` | Research | Analyze current session to extract agent/skill improvements |
| `tuneModels` | Research | Compare AI models and update agent model assignments |

**File format:** `prompts/promptName.prompt.md` (camelCase)

### Skills — Domain Knowledge

Skills contain everything an agent needs for a specific domain: facts, patterns, methodology, and rules. They're loaded on demand — only when the task is relevant.

Skills cover areas like:
- **Workflow methodology** — `autonomous-workflow`, `implementation-workflow`, `planning`, `testing-workflow`
- **Git operations** — `git-commits`, `git-diffs`, `git-push`, `git-sync`
- **Code quality** — `code-style-rules`, `architecture-principles`, `code-cleanup`, `code-migration`
- **PR lifecycle** — `pr-review`, `pr-workflow`, `pr-comment-drafting`
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — `multi-agent-review`, `multi-agent-planning`, `multi-agent-debugging`
- **Meta** — `agent-management`, `agent-conventions`, `skill-conventions`, `prompt-conventions`, `hook-conventions`, `instruction-conventions`
- **Project-specific** — `project-registry`, `project-reset`, `worktree-management`
- **Tech-specific** — `blaze-gotchas`, `i18n-text`, `mermaid-diagrams`
- **Agent operations** — `subagent-dispatch`, `subagent-response`, `model-selection`, `session-review`
- **Investigation** — `research`, `debugging`

Skills can also include executable scripts in a `scripts/` subdirectory for automated checks and transformations.

**File format:** `skills/skill-name/SKILL.md` (folder is lowercase-hyphenated, file is always `SKILL.md`)

### Instructions — Always-On Rules

Instructions are injected into every conversation automatically. They represent non-negotiable user preferences.

| Instruction | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `agent-autonomy` | When to ask the user vs proceed independently |
| `no-command-chaining` | Only allow `cd && command`, no arbitrary shell chaining |
| `no-terminal-edits` | Never use `sed`, `cat >`, heredocs to edit files — use built-in tools |
| `parallel-execution` | Parallelize independent work whenever possible |
| `response-formatting` | Output structure, diagrams, tables, file link format |

**File format:** `instructions/name.instructions.md` (lowercase-hyphenated)

### Hooks — Deterministic Enforcement

Hooks run shell scripts at agent lifecycle events. Unlike instructions and skills (which are advisory), hooks are **deterministic** — they execute regardless of what the agent decides.

**Pre-tool hooks** (run before a tool executes):

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `block-hooks-edit.sh` | Require approval before editing hook files |
| `block-force-push.sh` | Block `git push --force` (require `--force-with-lease`) |
| `scan-before-push.sh` | Scan diff for secrets/debug artifacts before push |
| `sandbox-git.sh` | Auto-approve safe git ops, block dangerous ones |
| `auto-approve-simple.sh` | Auto-approve non-destructive terminal commands |

**Post-tool hooks** (run after a tool completes):

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `auto-format.sh` | Auto-format edited files with Prettier |

**File format:** `hooks/global.json` (config) + `hooks/scripts/name.sh` (scripts)

## Common Workflows

### "I have a GitHub issue to implement"

1. Open chat, type `/implementTicketAuto` and paste the issue URL
2. The Implementation agent fetches the issue, researches the codebase, plans, creates a worktree, implements, self-reviews, pushes, and opens a draft PR — all autonomously

Or use `/implementTicketManual` if you want to approve the plan before coding starts.

### "I want to plan a feature before building it"

1. Type `/planFeature` and describe what you want to build
2. The Research agent investigates the codebase, creates a diagram-first plan, and presents it
3. Click the "Implement" handoff button to pass the plan to the Implementation agent

### "I want to review my changes before pushing"

1. Type `/reviewMyBranch`
2. The Research agent diffs your branch, runs through the self-review priority checklist (P1-P10), and presents findings one at a time
3. Fix issues, then `/commitCurrentChanges` and push

### "I need to review a colleague's PR"

1. Type `/reviewPR` and paste the PR URL
2. The Research agent fetches the PR and reviews with colleague-mode priorities
3. Approve drafted comments before they're posted

### "I want multiple perspectives on my code"

The Research agent can orchestrate multi-perspective reviews, plans, and debugging sessions using specialized subagents in parallel:
- **Review:** SecurityReviewer + ArchitectureReviewer + PerformanceReviewer + MaintainabilityReviewer all analyze your code independently, findings are merged
- **Plan:** 6 planners (Pragmatist, Craftsperson, Advocate, Security, Scalability, Conceptualist) each propose an approach, then they're synthesized
- **Debug:** DataIntegrity + ControlFlow + Concurrency + Environment investigators each pursue different hypotheses in parallel

### "I need to commit my changes"

1. Type `/commitCurrentChanges`
2. The agent reviews your diff, filters out sensitive files, generates a conventional commit message, and commits

### "I want to clean up before opening a PR"

1. `/cleanupBranch` — polish naming, style, diff quality
2. `/scanBranch` — scan for dead code, security issues, refactoring opportunities
3. `/reviewMyBranch` — final self-review

### "I want to improve the agents themselves"

1. Type `/reviewSession` after a work session
2. The Research agent analyzes the conversation for improvement signals
3. Approved changes are handed off to Implementation to apply

## Customization Guide

### Adding a New Prompt

Create `prompts/myPrompt.prompt.md`:

```markdown
---
name: myPrompt
description: What this prompt does
argument-hint: What optional input the user provides
agent: Implementation
---
One-sentence task summary.

## Steps

1. **Step name**
   Instructions with clear success criteria.
```

### Adding a New Skill

Create `skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: 'Brief description. Use for: keyword1, keyword2, keyword3.'
---
# My Skill

Domain knowledge — facts, patterns, how things work.

## Rules

**ALWAYS:**
- Required behavior

**NEVER:**
- Prohibited behavior
```

Then reference it in an agent's `<skills>` section: `Follow the 'my-skill' skill for [domain].`

### Adding a New Instruction

Create `instructions/my-rule.instructions.md`:

```markdown
---
name: My Rule
description: What this enforces
applyTo: '**'
---
# My Rule

Short, prescriptive rules. Keep concise — this is always injected.
```

### Adding a New Hook

1. Create the script in `hooks/scripts/my-hook.sh`
2. Add an entry in `hooks/global.json` under the appropriate lifecycle event
3. Review carefully — hooks execute with full system permissions

### Adding a New Agent

Only create a new agent when it has **unique tool access, constraints, or values**. If the difference is just the task type, create a prompt instead.

See the `agent-conventions` skill for the full template and architecture guide.

## Key Design Principles

- **Emergent behavior** — no single primitive prescribes the full approach. The agent synthesizes from goal + values + domain knowledge + user preferences.
- **Skills are contextual, instructions are global** — if a rule always matters, it's an instruction. If it only matters in a specific domain, it's a skill.
- **Hooks are deterministic** — when a rule MUST be enforced without exception, use a hook. Instructions and skills are advisory.
- **Lean orchestrators** — user-facing agents delegate specialized work to subagents with narrowly scoped tools.
- **Facts are descriptive, rules are prescriptive** — skills describe how things work and prescribe behavior in separate sections.

## What to Customize First

1. **Instructions** — these shape every interaction. Adjust `agent-autonomy`, `response-formatting`, and `parallel-execution` to match your preferences.
2. **Prompts** — add prompts for your common workflows. Start by copying an existing one.
3. **Skills** — add domain knowledge for your tech stack, project structure, and conventions.
4. **Hooks** — adjust safety rails. You may want different auto-approve patterns or additional pre-push checks.
5. **Agents** — the defaults work well for most use cases. Only add agents when you have genuinely different tool/value needs.

## Requirements
